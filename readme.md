#Unbound Deployment into AWS using Terraform

This is a terraform project to set up DNS resolution between your on-premises DNS with Amazon VPC by using Unbound, an open-source, recursive DNS resolver. This solution provides the ability to route DNS requests between on-premises environments and an Amazon VPCâ€“provided DNS.

The solution is documented on the following AWS Blog.
